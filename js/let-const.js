//when let and constant came in JS .. "var" was removed[no more use of 'var']
//let and const
//let : let it to reassign
//const : do not allow it to reassign [the value of constant value can not be changed if it decleared once]

let money = 25;
money = 30; //let value is reassignable
const balance = 35;
// const = 40; // const value is not reassignable.. but you can modify it(array and object)
